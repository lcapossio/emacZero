All notable changes to emacZero are recorded here for downstream integrators.
This project does not yet maintain long-lived release branches.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-06-10

Initial tagged integration baseline for the open-source Verilog Ethernet MAC.

### Security

- Added CRA-oriented security readiness documentation covering intended use,
  trust boundaries, security assumptions, residual risks, evidence expectations,
  and release traceability.
- Added private vulnerability reporting guidance, acknowledgement targets, and
  coordinated-disclosure expectations.
- Documented production hardening guidance for promiscuous mode, jumbo mode,
  checksum offload, debug capture, AXI4-Stream error handling, and regression
  evidence.

### Fixed

- Ran Verilator lint through WSL when launched from git-bash on Windows, so
  PHASE 0b can use either native Verilator or an auto-detected WSL install.
- Declared RTL signals ahead of first use to clear synthesis warnings.
- Made the Arty hardware smoke-test ARP check non-fatal when ICMP passes.
- Fixed jumbo testbench AXI4-Stream handshake coverage.
- Fixed MII TX FIFO count width handling.
- Collapsed MII length FIFOs and trimmed TX FIFO XPM features.
- Fixed MII RX replay buffering and per-run simulation output handling.

### Evidence
